# This manifest deploys the OpenEBS LVM control plane components,
# with associated CRs & RBAC rules.

# Create the OpenEBS namespace
# This is the default namespace where the LVM driver will create all
# its resources. If we want to change it to use a different namespace
# modify this to create the new namespace and also modify the LVM_NAMESPACE
# env for the LVM Driver's controller and agent deployments.
# please note that this should be changed while initial setup, once LVM Driver
# is deployed with a namespace, we should never modify it as old resources will
# not be available under the new namespace and LVM Driver looks for all the resources
# in the LVM_NAMESPACE namespace passed as an env.
